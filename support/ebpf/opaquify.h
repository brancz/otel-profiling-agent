// Hack to thwart the verifier's detection of variable bounds.
//
// In recent kernels (6.8 and above) the verifier has gotten smarter
// in its tracking of variable bounds. For example, after an if statement like
// `if (v1 < v2)`,
// if it already had computed bounds for v2, it can infer bounds
// for v1 in each side of the branch (and vice versa). This means it can verify more
// programs successfully, which doesn't matter to us because our program was
// verified successfully before. Unfortunately it has a downside which
// _does_ matter to us: it increases the number of unique verifier states,
// which can cause the same instructions to be explored many times, especially
// in cases where a value is carried through a loop and possibly has
// multiple sets of different bounds on each iteration of the loop, leading to
// a combinatorial explosion. This causes us to blow out the kernel's budget of
// maximum number of instructions verified on program load (currently 1M).
//
// `opaquify32` is a no-op; thus `opaquify32(x, anything)` has the same value as `x`.
// However, the verifier is unfortunately not smart enough to realize this,
// and will not realize the result has the same bounds as `x`, subverting the feature
// described above.
//
// For further discussion, see:
// https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/874jci5l3f.fsf@taipei.mail-host-address-is-not-set/
//
// if the verifier knows `val` is constant, you must set `seed`
// to something the verifier has no information about
// (if you don't have something handy, you can use `bpf_get_prandom_u32`).
// Otherwise, if the verifier knows bounds on `val` but not its exact value,
// it's fine to just use -1.
